# jetpack

Minimal, from-scratch webpack boilerplate with:
  - Coffeescript
  - Coffeelint
  - Stylus
  - Nib
  - Stylint
  - React
  - Skeleton CSS
  - Source maps + React Hot Loader 3.0 beta 3 for development
  - Deduplication + minification for production

# Usage

You may (and probably should) substitute `npm` with `yarn`.

- To install dependencies: `npm install && bower install`
- To start `webpack-dev-server`: `npm start`
- To build deduplicated, minified scripts into `static/`: `npm run build`
